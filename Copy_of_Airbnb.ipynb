        "   - **Guest Feedback**: Studying the number of reviews and reviews per month highlighted the importance of responding to guest feedback, addressing concerns, and actively encouraging positive reviews. This can enhance guest satisfaction and increase bookings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Host Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Host Collaboration**: By identifying hosts with a high number of listings, the client can collaborate with them to ensure a consistent and quality experience for guests.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Recommendations\n",
        "The analysis of the Airbnb dataset provided valuable insights and recommendations for the client. These insights include:\n",
        "- **Pricing Strategy**: Implement appropriate pricing ranges for different listing categories to set competitive prices and maximize revenue.\n",
